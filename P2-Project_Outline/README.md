# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The concept for this project has roots in my own work as a visual artist who has hundreds of artworks in circulation that are either stored in several places or on exhibit at any number of venues. When submitting your work to a show, every venue is going to have different requirements of what info that they need to know about your piece(s). Having a program to help keep track of those details, as well as the artwork's current whereabouts, is something that many artists would find extremely useful. 
### Features
These are the features I'd like to have initially.
    • User login: Users can create an account and log in to use the application.
    • Add Artwork: Users can create a listing for each piece.
    • Search: Users can search their entries.
    • Sold: Users can mark their work as sold to assist in sorting exercises.
    • Sort: Users can sort their entries by medium, location, or whether they are sold or available. 
### Technologies
I plan to use the following technologies:
    • Java
    • Springboot
    • Bootstrap
### What I'll Have to Learn
To make this work the way I'm hoping it to, I'll need to deepen my knowledge of Java, Springboot, and Bootstrap. I'd like to have a way to upload a picture of the works and be able to show those during search and sort functions. If not initially, in a future update. I'm also looking at using map API info to show a visual map of where artworks are located.
